# Arcane Next Phase

## Strategy

-   [x] Document the "Why" and "Roadmap" (Philosophy, Solo vs Enterprise)
-   [x] Fix Security Alerts & TUI Daemon control
-   [ ] Implement Stage/Prod Environments (Phase 1)
-   [ ] Implement Server Groups / Aliases (Phase 3)
-   [ ] Add Health Checks (Phase 4)
-   [ ] Deployment Tracking ("what goes where")

## Notes

-   "Arcane Spark" (build server) is designed but deferred (Phase 5).
-   Focusing on **Env Management** first as it unlocks everything else.
-   Servers like 'oracle' might host both Stage and Prod, or different servers for each.
